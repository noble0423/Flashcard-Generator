# Flashcard-Generator

## Objective

In this application, you will be asked a series of flashcard-questions relating to U.S. cities and states. See how many you can answer correctly.

### How it works

* Each question will be prompted to the user in the terminal screen. 

* Answer each question by typing in your answer into the text input area within terminal screen.

    * While you do not need to worry about capitization (all lowercase, all uppercase, mixture of both, etc.), you must use the correct spelling or your answer will be incorrect.

    * Press the enter key to submit your answer and you will be able to see if you were right or wrong as well as what the correct answer is. 
    
    * Upon completing these steps, your next flashcard question will be prompted automatically.

* After you answer all 10 of the flashcard questions, your game stats will appear in the terminal informing you of the total questions asked, the total correct answers, and the total incorrect answers.

* To play again, simply restart the app.
